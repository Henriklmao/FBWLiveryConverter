![FlyByWire LiveryConverter](/Resources/fbwps.png)
 Open source Conversion tool for incompatible A320 livery's to be used with the FlyByWire A32NX mod. 

### Why?
One of the latest FBW updates made the A32nx independent from the default A320, thus every livery does no longer work with the A32nx. Many members out of the community are upset as they want to fly for their favourite airlines again thus we ([Henrik](https://github.com/henriklmao "My GitHub") and [Skyline](https://github.com/wunderkekshd "His GitHub")) decided to write this conversion tool.

### But why this program if there are other Solutions for that?
The other programs for that are batch (.bat or .cmd) files, sometimes even packed with "echo" commands that are not needed to buff the program to look like something professional. Everyone knows that it is easier and more lightweight to make a batch file, but why do these people buff their batch files. You have to manually drag the batch files into the livery file and it all takes quite a long time to execute while this program has a user friendly GUI to make it easier for the end user.
