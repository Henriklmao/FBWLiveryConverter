# How to install and use the Livery Converter
THIS PAGE IS NOT YET FINISHED...
## Installation

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/Henriklmao/FBWLiveryConverter/releases "get the latest release").

## Convert
Inside of the application, you can open an explorer window. In this window navigate to your Community folder and select the livery you want to convert. If the livery is not valid you will get an error message. If you get an error message even though you think you did everything right, then try to get some help [here](https://github.com/Henriklmao/FBWLiveryConverter/blob/main/DOCS/Exceptions.md "Stop it, get some Help!").

## Rollback
If the converted livery doesn't show up in the simulator for some reason, you  don't have to worry. We always create backups before we modify anything.
Just select the problematic livery again and now a new option called "Rollback" shows up. Click on that and the changes we made are reverted.
