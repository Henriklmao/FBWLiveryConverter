THIS PAGE IS NOT YET FINISHED...
## Installation

Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/Henriklmao/FBWLiveryConverter/releases "get the latest release").

## Usage
Inside of the application, you can open an explorer window. In this window navigate to your Community folder and select the livery you want to convert. If the livery is not valid you will get an error message. If you get an error message even though you think you did everything right, then try to get some help [here](https://github.com/Henriklmao/FBWLiveryConverter/blob/main/DOCS/Exceptions.md "Stop it, get some Help!").
