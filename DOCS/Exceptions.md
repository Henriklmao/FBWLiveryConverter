# Livery Converter support page
If you get an exception that is not listed here, please 

## Index was outside of bounds of the array
If you experience following issue...
![IndexOutOfBounds](/assets/IndexOutOfBounds.png)
then the LiveryConverter couldn't find the aircraft.cfg file. The livery is probably corrupted. Also, the livery shouldn't have ever worked then. If it did, please [report that here](https://github.com/Henriklmao/FBWLiveryConverter/issues "File your issue")
(Maybe also append the livery you tried to convert as a zip if possible, thus we can help you easier.)

## Livery file x misisng
If you see the following message
![LiveryFileMissing](/assets/LiveryFileMissing.png)
Please note that where aircraft.cfg is in this screen, any other file can be there instead.
Your livery may be broken as we cannot detect file x. You livery is probably corrupted.
